Intro
-----

Please, make sure to read everything, that includes the final considerations at the end.

This is a coding challenge provided by [Capim.](https://capim.com.br)

For absolutely no reason at all, I decided that Capim stands for Grass and made it the Game theme, sorry.

I'm not the most creative guy when it comes to visuals, so I used [this](https://emojicombos.com/grass-ascii-art) *ASCII* art and all the silly lines used in the game were generated by [ChatGPT.](https://chat.openai.com/chat) Some of them don't make that much sense, but i like the quirkiness of it ðŸ˜¼

Installation
------------

#### Installing the gem

Install the capim tictactoe gem
```
gem install capim_tictactoe
```

#### Tests

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/itsmaia/capim-tictactoe
```

Install the dependencies
```
bundle install
```

To run the test suite
```
bundle exec rspec
```

#### Execute

You can run the game with
```ruby 
capim_tictactoe
```

CI/CD
-----

Feel free to open a pull request, passing all tests and static analysis is mandatory.

The gem will only be deployed to [rubygems](https://rubygems.org) when a new release tag is created.

Final Considerations
--------------------

Refactoring can be a bit hard. Not necessarily because the code is hard to understand, but because to do anything with it, you have to put everything in place first.

 Although I think a coding challenge like this is a good way to assess the candidate skills, it can take a decent amount of time to complete. This means that some candidates might want to put 5 hours into it, and others might want to put 15. Using the same measuring stick to everyone might lead to false assumptions and expectations.

 And, of course, it only tests my Ruby *off* Rails skills.

It is, however, very creative and fun! I completed this on my free time and, besides writing the tests ðŸ¤­, it was rather enjoyable to do. Challenges like this are the "Jacket on, Jacket off" of programming, and are always worth doing IMO.

Also, im trying to get better with [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim), so it was good Vim practice ;p
